# Remove Youtube Suggestions
### A Firefox Add On to hide all suggestions from the youtube sidebar

"Remove Youtube Suggestions" hides the homepage and the videos that appear on the sidebar.
Motivated by an attempt to stymie the "YouTube rabbit hole."

### Why should I use this plugin
Because the Google neural networks is built to select the most relevant suggested videos to recommend to you, and it works damn good.
This sets in motion the brain's automatic response to click on video even if you weren't really interested, wasting your time unnecessarily.
