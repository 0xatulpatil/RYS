# Remove Youtube Suggestions
### A Firefox Add On to hide all suggestions from the youtube sidebar

"Remove Youtube Suggestions" hides the homepage and the videos that appear on the sidebar.
Motivated by an attempt to stymie the "YouTube rabbit hole."

### Why should I use this plugin
Google optimizes for the most engaging videos to recommend, and not necessarily the best content. Their ideal recommendations set in motion the brain's automatic response to click â€” even if you weren't really interested and often results in a waste of your time.

Available for install here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remove-youtube-s-suggestions/
