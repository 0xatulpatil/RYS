# Remove Youtube Suggestions
### A Firefox Add On to hide all suggestions from the youtube sidebar

"Remove Youtube Suggestions" hides the homepage and the videos that appear on the sidebar.
Motivated by an attempt to stymie the "YouTube rabbit hole."

### Why should I use this plugin
Google optimizes for the most engaging videos to recommend to you.
This sets in motion the brain's automatic response to click on video even if you weren't really interested, wasting your time.

Available for install here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remove-youtube-s-suggestions/
