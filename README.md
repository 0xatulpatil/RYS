# Remove Youtube Suggestions
### A Firefox Add-On to hide all suggestions from the YouTube

"Remove Youtube Suggestions" hides the homepage and the videos that appear on the sidebar.
Motivated by an attempt to stymie the "YouTube rabbit hole."

### Why should I use this plugin?
Google optimizes recommendations to be the most _engaging_ videos. Their ideal recommendation sets in motion the brain's automatic response to click â€” regardless if you are interested or not. Persistent exposure to these suggestions results in a waste of your time. So download this add-on and remove them as you please!
