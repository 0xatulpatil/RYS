# Remove Youtube Suggestions
#### A Browser Extension


### What does it do?
This project hides Youtube recommendations, motivated by an attempt to stymie the "YouTube rabbit hole."

### Why should I use this plugin?
The YouTube recommendation algorithm optimizes for the most _engaging_ videos, regardless if you are interested or not. Persistent exposure to these suggestions results in a waste of your time. So download this add-on and remove unwanted suggestions as you please!
