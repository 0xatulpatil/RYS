# Remove Youtube Suggestions
#### A Firefox Extension


### What does it do?
This project hides Youtube recommendations, motivated by an attempt to stymie the "YouTube rabbit hole."

### Why should I use this plugin?
Google optimizes recommendations to be the most _engaging_ videos. Their ideal recommendation sets in motion the brain's automatic response to click â€” regardless if you are interested or not. Persistent exposure to these suggestions results in a waste of your time. So download this add-on and remove them as you please!

Available for install here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remove-youtube-s-suggestions/
